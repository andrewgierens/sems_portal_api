# SEMS Portal

## Description
SEMS Portal is a simple wrapper designed to interact with various APIs exposed by a specific website. It simplifies the process of sending requests and handling responses, making it easier for developers to integrate and work with the available services.

## Features
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with APIs
- Open-source with an MIT License

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python version >=3.5

### Installation
To install SEMS Portal API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrewgierens/sems_portal_api.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
To use SEMS Portal, you need to have Python and `aiohttp` installed. Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio
from sems_portal_api import login_to_sems

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        account = "your_account"
        password = "your_password"
        
        data = await login_to_sems(session, account, password)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, we import the required modules and define an `async` main function. Inside this function, we create an `aiohttp.ClientSession`, which is used to send an HTTP request to the SEMS portal for logging in. Replace `"your_account"` and `"your_password"` with your actual login credentials.

The `login_to_sems` function takes three parameters: the session, account, and password, and it returns the data received from the SEMS portal. The returned data is then printed to the console.
